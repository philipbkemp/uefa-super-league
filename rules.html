				<li class="list-group-item">Teams in the National Top Flight will always take part.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Only official National Top Flights are included. Any Top Flight in knockout, regional, or other non-single-tiered format will not be included.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">A win is always worth 3 points, a draw 1, and a loss 0.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Teams are ranked by their 'Points Per Game' score.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">In case of a tie, teams will then be separated by: 'Goals For Per Game', then 'Goals Against Per Game'.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">The League is split into 8 Divisions, each with a maximum of 100 Teams.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">At the end of each Season, 10 teams will be Relegated from each Division, with 10 teams Promoted to replace them.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Teams that relegated, or otherwise eliminated from their National Top Flight are Removed from the League. This will count as one of the 10 Relegated Teams from their current Division.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">More than 10 Teams can be Releagated if they are relegated or eliminated from their National Top Flight. In this case, the appropriate number of Teams will be Promoted to restore the Division to 100 Teams.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">New or Returning Teams are added to the lowest Division with spaces. If this requires a split over multiple Divisions, the best of the New/Returning Teams will be added first.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">If a Team has a points deduction, the same deduction will also be enforced in this League.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">UEFA issued bans will not take effect in this League.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">For National Top Flights taking part over a single calendar year, these are added to the Season in which they would qualify for UEFA Competitions.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Merged clubs are effectively treated as a New Team, and must start from the lowest Division available. The Teams that competed before the merger are all removed.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">A National Top Flight that takes place over a single calendar year (instead of the standard 2 year format) will be treated as having taken part in the Season where the year is the first year. For example: Season 1900 will be recorded in 1900-01.
